The HDN FIGRZ (HIDDEN FIGURES) Collection will have some HDN Merch.<br/><br/>

There will be 3 Super-Rare (Diamond) NFTs and 7 Rare (Platinum) NFTs.
Each Diamond NFT will have a vehicle attached to it.<br/><br/> 

We are giving away a Mercedes EQS, a Jeep Wrangler, and a Tesla Model S.
Every Platinum NFT will have $15k in crypto attached to it.<br/><br/>

These 10 exclusive NFTs will be randomly dispersed in the collection. So get on the List ASAP. Because the only way to reveal what is HDN, is to bag an NFT, or two, or three…you get the point.<br/><br/>

Oh yeah, AND we will be giving away NFTs and crypto leading up to the public launch. So you probably want to stay locked in to The Blueprint.
