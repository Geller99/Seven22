The first thing to realise is that there are significant additional costs besides the purchase price. Let\u2019s run through them and look at a few examples.</p>\n<p><strong>Purchase price.</strong> The purchase price is what you end up offering the seller. Remember, the seller sets an asking price and you can (almost) always negotiate and offer\u00a0less.</p>\n<p><strong>Taxes and duties.</strong> Transfer duty is a tax levied by SARS when you buy a property unless your circumstances allow you to be exempted. It\u2019s calculated according to a <a href=\"https://www.sars.gov.za/tax-rates/transfer-duty/\">table</a>, based on the purchase price. There\u2019s no transfer duty if the purchase price is R1 million or\u00a0less.</p>\n<p><strong>Transfer costs.</strong> There\u2019s a legal process that has to be followed when you transfer a property into your name. The seller will appoint a conveyancing attorney and you as the buyer must cover the conveyancing fees. Not many people realise that these fees are negotiable! Read the <a href=\"https://www.lssa.org.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/CONVEYANCING-GUIDELINES-MAY-22-FINAL.pdf\">fee guidelines</a> published by The Law Society of South Africa and speak to the seller about a discount. Conveyancing fees will also include deeds registration fees and sundries like courier fees, printing, etc. There might also be a fee for managing the process of registering your bond (see\u00a0below).</p>\n<p><strong>Bond registration.</strong> If you plan to get a home loan (also known as a mortgage bond), take note that it\u2019s not as easy (or cheap) as opening a bank account. You might have to pay an initiation fee (R6,038 maximum, as prescribed by the National Credit Act) and a bond registration fee to register the loan against the property\u2019s title deed. There will also be other minor fees for the deeds office, like postage, petties\u00a0etc.</p>\n<p><strong>Yikes!

Here\u2019s how to do\u00a0it:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Avoid scrolling the online aisles.</strong> One of the reasons we overspend is because it\u2019s so easy to spend. Waiting in a queue, watching a boring TV show, taking a five-minute break from work\u2026 Out comes the phone and off we go into the wonderful world of Facebook Marketplace, Takealot, Instagram, Superbalist and any number of other online spending traps. Put a one-month freeze on your scrolling and see how much you\u00a0save.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Unsubscribe* from newsletters.</strong> This tip goes hand-in-hand with the first one. Instead of shops relying on you to find your way to their site, a newsletter is far more direct. It\u2019s delivered straight to your mailbox so you can ponder how badly you need that pair of jeans that is now 30% off. Don\u2019t let temptation find you. Unsubscribe!</p>\n<p>* Except for this one\u200a\u2014\u200aSlice helps you\u00a0save!</p>\n<p><strong>3. Try to eat out less.</strong> Are you going to stop ordering pizza on a Friday night? Probably not. But are you going to avoid fast food restaurants during the week? Yes, you are! You can save a ton of money by preparing your meals for the week at home. Challenge yourself and try some new recipes or do a theme night where you cook a dish from a different country. Most importantly, only go to the grocery store with a list and a full\u00a0tummy.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Leave your credit card at home.</strong> There\u2019s nothing more tempting than swiping your credit card for R150 here and R300 there if you come across a sale at the mall. But if you leave your credit card at home, and the money you have on your debit card is already budgeted for necessities, then you\u2019ll be forced to reconsider.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Do it yourself.</strong> Learn how to paint your own nails, wash your car yourself\u2026 Heck, even learn how to unblock the shower drain. All these skills will make you more independent and you\u2019ll save plenty of cash if you don\u2019t have to pay other people to fix small problems.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Be honest with yourself. </strong>Ask the tough questions: Why do I spend so much on certain things every month? Why can\u2019t I find joy in anything other than retail therapy? Most of us spend because spending makes us happy, not because we need to. The more you learn about yourself, the healthier your spending habits\u00a0become.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Treat yourself!</strong> This might seem counterintuitive, but if you don\u2019t buy yourself something nice now and then, you\u2019ll end up \u2018rewarding\u2019 your cost-cutting by going on a massive binge and all your hard work will be wasted. That\u2019s human nature. Rather budget for the things you want, plan for them, and save up for good-quality items that will last longer, or for a life experience that will mean more than a quick R500 purchase every\u00a0weekend.</p>\n<p>Remember, the less you spend, the more you save, and the happier you\u2019ll be in the long run. Give it a\u00a0try!</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=b8e8c7272ddc\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n",

Most importantly, only go to the grocery store with a list and a full\u00a0tummy.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Leave your credit card at home.</strong> There\u2019s nothing more tempting than swiping your credit card for R150 here and R300 there if you come across a sale at the mall. But if you leave your credit card at home, and the money you have on your debit card is already budgeted for necessities, then you\u2019ll be forced to reconsider.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Do it yourself.</strong> Learn how to paint your own nails, wash your car yourself\u2026 Heck, even learn how to unblock the shower drain. All these skills will make you more independent and you\u2019ll save plenty of cash if you don\u2019t have to pay other people to fix small problems.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Be honest with yourself. </strong>Ask the tough questions: Why do I spend so much on certain things every month? Why can\u2019t I find joy in anything other than retail therapy? Most of us spend because spending makes us happy, not because we need to. The more you learn about yourself, the healthier your spending habits\u00a0become.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Treat yourself!</strong> This might seem counterintuitive, but if you don\u2019t buy yourself something nice now and then, you\u2019ll end up \u2018rewarding\u2019 your cost-cutting by going on a massive binge and all your hard work will be wasted. That\u2019s human nature. Rather budget for the things you want, plan for them, and save up for good-quality items that will last longer, or for a life experience that will mean more than a quick R500 purchase every\u00a0weekend.</p>\n<p>Remember, the less you spend, the more you save, and the happier you\u2019ll be in the long run. Give it a\u00a0try!</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=b8e8c7272ddc\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n",

There\u2019s actually no such thing as \u2018good\u2019 debt, it\u2019s just that some loans make more sense than others.

Here\u2019s your\u00a0guide.</p>\n<p><strong>\u2018Good\u2019 debt</strong></p>\n<p>Will the purchase increase in value over time, potentially generate an income, or become an asset? Will this debt contribute to your quality of life in the long term? Here are some examples of \u2018good\u2019\u00a0debt:</p>\n<p><em>\u2022 Buying property.</em> Unless you have a very rich (and generous) uncle, most people have to go into debt to finance a property. But once a property is paid off, it becomes an asset, and it might increase in value over time, giving you the option of selling it for a profit. A property can also provide a rental income, or a space where you can live rent-free.</p>\n<p><em>\u2022 Getting an education.</em> With the ever-increasing cost of higher education, a student loan might be your only way to obtain a certain qualification. But it\u2019s a good investment because you\u2019ll hopefully increase your earning potential and open more doors for future employment.</p>\n<p><em>\u2022 Starting a business.</em> This one\u2019s not so clear-cut. With a small business loan, you could take your side hustle off the ground and be your own boss, potentially increasing your earnings and your net worth. But in reality, it\u2019s probably not that simple. Do proper research and a full risk assessment to determine the viability of your business plan before you sign any loan documents.</p>\n<p><strong>Bad debt</strong></p>\n<p>If you get into debt for a purchase that doesn\u2019t check any of the \u2018good\u2019 debt checkboxes, it\u2019s probably bad debt. Bad debt attracts a higher interest rate since it\u2019s usually not tied to an asset that can be used for collateral and is therefore riskier for the lender. Here are two examples:</p>\n<p><em>\u2022 Credit cards and store cards. </em>If you pay off your credit card in full each month, all good. But if your spending gets out of hand, credit card debt has a very high interest rate and you\u2019ll soon be in over your head. The same goes for a clothing or store account, which also has a high interest rate and a monthly service fee. When considering a purchase on credit, remember the golden rule: If you can\u2019t afford it in cash, you probably shouldn\u2019t pay for it with your\u00a0card.</p>\n<p><em>\u2022 Buying things you can\u2019t afford.</em><strong> </strong>AKA reckless spending. The unchecked buying of luxury items and nonessentials on credit or account can lead to debt misery. This is why it\u2019s so important to track your spending and create a budget using 22seven. Ask yourself: Is this a want or a need? Am I better off saving for this item, or just saving the money? Whether it\u2019s clothes, holidays or entertainment, if you didn\u2019t budget for it, you shouldn\u2019t buy it on\u00a0credit.</p>\n<p><strong>What about buying a\u00a0car?</strong></p>\n<p>Good debt, bad debt? A car is a bit of both. Because it\u2019s a depreciating asset, financing a car is bad debt, in theory. But a car can also improve your quality of life by getting you where you need to be safely. So, as long as you shop sensibly and you can afford your monthly vehicle payment, plus all the associated costs like petrol and insurance\u200a\u2014\u200aand you\u2019ve included those costs in your budget\u200a\u2014\u200ait could be worth going ahead with the\u00a0loan.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, it\u2019s all about being conscious of your spending.

But how? SARS offers a variety of incentives that are sometimes hard to understand. Let\u2019s discuss three of the most common, each of which offers real bang for your\u00a0buck.</p>\n<p>We\u2019ll use two taxpayers as examples: Thembi, who earns R1,4 million per year and who has a husband and two children reliant on her income; and Andy, who earns R500,000 per year and has no dependents.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Max out your retirement savings</strong></p>\n<p>Contributions you make to a retirement fund (provident fund, pension fund or retirement annuity) are deductible from your taxable income, up to a certain limit. In other words, the amount that SARS uses to calculate how much tax you pay is reduced, so you pay less tax. The flip side is that you\u2019re also putting away money for later in life, which is always a good\u00a0thing.</p>\n<p>SARS allows you to deduct R350,000 or 27,5% of your taxable income, whichever is less. Excess contributions roll over to future years. Thembi, for example, can contribute the full R350,000 and Andy can contribute up to R137,500.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*sFzkAVHxd6BnTO_GIN_n_w.png\"></figure><p><strong>2. Contribute to a tax-free savings\u00a0account</strong></p>\n<p>Tax-free savings accounts (TFSAs) were created to help South Africans save more. Contributing to a TFSA is different to putting money into a retirement fund because you invest after you\u2019ve paid tax (your taxable income is not reduced), but the good thing is that all the growth within the account is tax-free.</p>\n<p>You\u2019re allowed to invest R36,000 per year, up to a maximum of R500,000 over your lifetime. Any excess contributions above R36,000 per year will be taxed at 40%. Unused contributions don\u2019t roll over to the next year. You can withdraw from the fund at any time, but once you\u2019ve taken money out you can\u2019t replace\u00a0it.</p>\n<p>Confused? Let\u2019s see how Thembi makes it work. Through good budgeting, she manages to contribute R36,000 into a TFSA each year, reaching her R500K limit in just over 13 years. She leaves the money invested for another 10 years, by which time it has grown, let\u2019s say to R900K. At that stage, she can withdraw the growth on the investment (R400K) without having to pay any tax. She could withdraw the full amount and not pay tax\u00a0either.</p>\n<p>Putting money into a TFSA is a great way to save for the long-term\u200a\u2014\u200ato supplement your retirement income, for example, or to provide for your children\u2019s education.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Medical scheme deductions</strong></p>\n<p>A portion of your medical scheme contributions can be deducted from the tax you have to pay each year. It\u2019s called \u2018medical credits\u2019 and this is what\u2019s\u00a0allowed:</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*rq5QnaOCtbUu3pX-TOPksg.png\"></figure><p><em>* SARS does allow additional medical deductions based on a formula. Read about it on the SARS\u00a0website.</em></p>\n<p>Using the table above (and ignoring additional medical deductions), for the 2022 tax year Thembi can deduct R1,132 per month (or R13,584 per year) from the tax she has to pay, because she has three dependents. Andy, on the other hand, can deduct R347 per month (or R4,164 per\u00a0year).</p>\n<p><strong>3. Get your ducks in a\u00a0row</strong></p>\n<p>To take advantage of these incentives, you need to get your home accounting up to scratch and you need to provide SARS with all the proof they require. If your medical scheme and retirement contributions are managed by your employer, speak to your HR manager. If you\u2019re self-employed, or if your income is made up of lots of different streams, it might be worth chatting to a tax professional who will be able to advise you on all the loopholes and regulations and other tax that might be applicable to\u00a0you.</p>\n<p>Take some time to browse the <a href=\"https://www.sars.gov.za/\">SARS website</a>, which has all the information about deductions and tax concepts. Do your homework and save this tax\u00a0season!</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=219b03f3e791\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n",
            "content": "\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*yOOojcfRNjimjp1l5AQBjA.png\"></figure><p>It\u2019s that time of year again\u2026 When you pay tax, you only want to pay what is due, preferably not a cent more. But how? SARS offers a variety of incentives that are sometimes hard to understand. Let\u2019s discuss three of the most common, each of which offers real bang for your\u00a0buck.</p>\n<p>We\u2019ll use two taxpayers as examples: Thembi, who earns R1,4 million per year and who has a husband and two children reliant on her income; and Andy, who earns R500,000 per year and has no dependents.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Max out your retirement savings</strong></p>\n<p>Contributions you make to a retirement fund (provident fund, pension fund or retirement annuity) are deductible from your taxable income, up to a certain limit. In other words, the amount that SARS uses to calculate how much tax you pay is reduced, so you pay less tax. The flip side is that you\u2019re also putting away money for later in life, which is always a good\u00a0thing.</p>\n<p>SARS allows you to deduct R350,000 or 27,5% of your taxable income, whichever is less. Excess contributions roll over to future years. Thembi, for example, can contribute the full R350,000 and Andy can contribute up to R137,500.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*sFzkAVHxd6BnTO_GIN_n_w.png\"></figure><p><strong>2. Contribute to a tax-free savings\u00a0account</strong></p>\n<p>Tax-free savings accounts (TFSAs) were created to help South Africans save more. Contributing to a TFSA is different to putting money into a retirement fund because you invest after you\u2019ve paid tax (your taxable income is not reduced), but the good thing is that all the growth within the account is tax-free.</p>\n<p>You\u2019re allowed to invest R36,000 per year, up to a maximum of R500,000 over your lifetime. Any excess contributions above R36,000 per year will be taxed at 40%. Unused contributions don\u2019t roll over to the next year. You can withdraw from the fund at any time, but once you\u2019ve taken money out you can\u2019t replace\u00a0it.</p>\n<p>Confused? Let\u2019s see how Thembi makes it work. Through good budgeting, she manages to contribute R36,000 into a TFSA each year, reaching her R500K limit in just over 13 years. She leaves the money invested for another 10 years, by which time it has grown, let\u2019s say to R900K. At that stage, she can withdraw the growth on the investment (R400K) without having to pay any tax. She could withdraw the full amount and not pay tax\u00a0either.</p>\n<p>Putting money into a TFSA is a great way to save for the long-term\u200a\u2014\u200ato supplement your retirement income, for example, or to provide for your children\u2019s education.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Medical scheme deductions</strong></p>\n<p>A portion of your medical scheme contributions can be deducted from the tax you have to pay each year. It\u2019s called \u2018medical credits\u2019 and this is what\u2019s\u00a0allowed:</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*rq5QnaOCtbUu3pX-TOPksg.png\"></figure><p><em>* SARS does allow additional medical deductions based on a formula. Read about it on the SARS\u00a0website.</em></p>\n<p>Using the table above (and ignoring additional medical deductions), for the 2022 tax year Thembi can deduct R1,132 per month (or R13,584 per year) from the tax she has to pay, because she has three dependents. Andy, on the other hand, can deduct R347 per month (or R4,164 per\u00a0year).</p>\n<p><strong>3. Get your ducks in a\u00a0row</strong></p>\n<p>To take advantage of these incentives, you need to get your home accounting up to scratch and you need to provide SARS with all the proof they require. If your medical scheme and retirement contributions are managed by your employer, speak to your HR manager. If you\u2019re self-employed, or if your income is made up of lots of different streams, it might be worth chatting to a tax professional who will be able to advise you on all the loopholes and regulations and other tax that might be applicable to\u00a0you.</p>\n<p>Take some time to browse the <a href=\"https://www.sars.gov.za/\">SARS website</a>, which has all the information about deductions and tax concepts.

It\u2019s daunting to sign that bond document and think that you\u2019ll be paying for your house for the next 20 or even 30\u00a0years.</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t have to be that way. Yes, buying a property is a long-term financial commitment, but with good planning and discipline you can pay off your bond much sooner and save tens if not hundreds of thousands of rand in interest.</p>\n<p>Here are some tips to help you get over the\u00a0line.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Check your credit score before you\u00a0sign</strong></p>\n<p>Before you apply for a home loan, check your <a href=\"https://22seven.medium.com/lets-talk-about-your-credit-score-9ae66fb58353\">credit score</a>. It\u2019s a number based on your credit history, influenced by things like your total amount of debt, how many accounts you have, and what your repayment history looks like. A good credit score will help you get a lower interest rate on your home loan, which will reduce the total amount you\u2019ll pay\u00a0back.</p>\n<p>If your credit score isn\u2019t looking so hot, consider putting steps in place to improve your score before applying for a large bond and locking yourself into a higher interest rate. You\u2019ll save a huge amount in the long\u00a0run.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Save for a bigger\u00a0deposit</strong></p>\n<p>The more you can pay for your house upfront, the less you\u2019ll have to borrow from the\u00a0bank.</p>\n<p>Create a budget using 22seven and allocate a specific amount to save for your deposit each month. The benefit is twofold: you\u2019ll pay less interest on a smaller loan; and when you eventually get that loan, you\u2019ll already have the skills and experience to manage your expenses and <a href=\"https://22seven.medium.com/how-to-start-saving-for-real-this-time-16f20bae5a7f\">save wherever you\u00a0can</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Pay more than the minimum monthly\u00a0amount</strong></p>\n<p>Once you have a bond, try your best to pay more than the mandatory minimum monthly instalment. Even small extra payments will snowball over time, shaving years off your payment period and saving on interest\u00a0costs.</p>\n<p>Remember that the interest rate fluctuates over time due to inflation and economic circumstances. If the interest rate goes down, avoid the temptation to decrease your monthly payments accordingly.</p>\n<p>Similarly, if you receive any additional cash\u200a\u2014\u200aa bonus, inheritance, tax back from SARS, salary increase, anything!\u200a\u2014\u200aput it into your bond. Live humbly, pour money into your bond and watch the repayment amount tumble. You\u2019re\u00a0winning!</p>\n<p><strong>4. Clear your other\u00a0debt</strong></p>\n<p>If you have any other high-interest debt\u200a\u2014\u200aon a credit or store card, for example\u200a\u2014\u200atry to <a href=\"https://22seven.medium.com/a-a-avalanche-how-to-get-rid-of-your-debt-for-good-bd26e3f9b303\">settle it as soon as possible</a>. Clear the decks and pay everything you were paying towards all your debt towards your bond\u00a0alone.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Pro tip: Get an access\u00a0bond</strong></p>\n<p>If you\u2019re worried about putting all your extra savings into your bond and not being able to access that money in case of emergency, an access bond is a great solution. You can withdraw any amount in the bond over and above the minimum repayment. It\u2019s genius: you can access your savings and\u200a\u2014\u200ayou guessed it!\u200a\u2014\u200asave on interest at the same\u00a0time.</p>\n<p>Buying a property is a massive step in your financial journey.

It\u2019s the same with investing. You need to work out a plan and stick to that plan so that you can reap the rewards down the\u00a0track.</p>\n<p>In other words, you need to get into the habit of investing well. Here\u2019s how to do\u00a0it.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Start with a\u00a0goal</strong></p>\n<p>To use our Comrades example, your goal might be to run a bronze-medal time. When you\u2019re investing, you need an equally specific goal, otherwise your saving plan will lack direction.</p>\n<p>Retirement is an obvious goal for many people, but it doesn\u2019t have to be your only goal. You can invest for your retirement while saving for various other goals at the same time. (Just like you can train for the Comrades by running a whole bunch of half-marathons in the lead-up.)</p>\n<p><strong>2. Make a\u00a0plan</strong></p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve got your goals in sight, you need to make plans to reach them. The strategy you use for each goal depends on the investment timeline and the goal itself. For example, investing for retirement is a long-term goal. Leaving your money invested for decades will allow you to ride out market volatility and reap maximum benefits from compounding.

In this case, you\u2019d choose an investment product like a <a href=\"https://22seven.medium.com/savings-account-or-money-market-fund-19379371964c\">money market account</a>, which might not give you the same returns as a longer-term retirement product, but it gives you instant access to the funds when you need\u00a0them.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Be consistent</strong></p>\n<p>You\u2019re running the Comrades, right? Don\u2019t suddenly decide you\u2019d rather paddle the Dusi! The key to successful investing is to believe in your goal and stick to your plan, regardless of the latest crypto fad or market\u00a0noise.</p>\n<p>Stay consistent with your contributions. To make sure you save each and every month, set up debit orders for your investments to automatically go into the selected strategies that fuel your\u00a0goals.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Keep an eye on the small\u00a0things</strong></p>\n<p>It\u2019s important to follow your big-picture plan, but it\u2019s just as important to keep an eye on the small things. Watch your fees, for example, and see if there\u2019s an equivalent investment product that costs less but will still allow you to reach your\u00a0goal.</p>\n<p>Investing well also has a lot to do with cutting costs.
